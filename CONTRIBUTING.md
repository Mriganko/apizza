# Contributing to apizza

So I have very little experience contributing or running open source projects so just like make a pull request or whatever.

I'll keep it pretty chill, but just make sure you follow theses guidlines:
- Test your code before you commit it
- Run `gofmt` to format the code
- Work off of the dev branch

#### Issuse
If you find something wrong just file a new issue and I'll do my best to address it.

#### Testing
The tests for the dawg package use two environment variables for the dominos testing account.

`DOMINOS_TEST_USER` is the email for the dominos testing account

`DOMINOS_TEST_PASS` is the password for the testing account
